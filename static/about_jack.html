                    Computer gamer, software engineer, student, motorcycle speeder, skateboarder; Jack has picked up many
                    skills and interests throughout his life, but one thing that has remained constant is his passion
                    for computers. Since he was 6, he has been infatuated with the inner workings of computer hardware,
                    software, and networks. Today, he is completing his last semester to earn his Bachelors in Computer
                    Science before heading out into the wild field of professional software development.
