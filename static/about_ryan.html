                    Born and raised in the heart of the Bay Area, Ryan has always been intrigued by the constantly evolving technology
                    surrounding him on the daily. Spending most of his time growing up playing basketball or hanging out with friends,
                    he always found time to play his video games.  This is what fueled his passion and love for computers.  Currently
                    attending his last semester at San Francisco State University pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science,
                    Ryan is eager to display his skills in the hopes of getting recruited by a top company.
