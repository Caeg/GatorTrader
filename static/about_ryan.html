                    Living in the heart of the Bay Area, Ryan has always been intrigued by the constant evolving technology
                    surrounding him daily. Spending most of his time growing up playing basketball or spending time with friends,
                    he always found time to play his video games.  This is what fueled his passion

                    <!-- Computer gamer, software engineer, student, motorcycle speeder, skateboarder; Jack has picked up many
                    skills and interests throughout his life, but one thing that has remained constant is his passion
                    for computers. Since he was 6, he has been infatuated with the inner workings of computer hardware,
                    software, and networks. Today, he is completing his last semester to earn his Bachelors in Computer
                    Science before heading out into the wild field of professional software development. -->
