Since we aren't using Trello (or whatever the task management software is called) yet,
I'll just list what we're supposed to do here.

All members:
    Shall create an About page.
    - Shall have a picture and description about them self
    - Shall use Bootstrap 4
        - Go to bootstrap's website and use their CDN (CDN means remote location that is globally distributed)
         to embed it by copying their two lines of code. No need to download anything and put it in the project
    - Shall be made using a separate branch that branches off the "develop" branch
        - The branch shall be named "about-firstname", e.g "about-jack"
        - The commits shall be descriptive, e.g. "Changed image size to scale on mobile" not "Changed image"
    - Shall follow the naming convention for the files
        - Replace "firstname" with your first name in all examples
        - All files shall be lowercase
        - Your HTML file shall be static/about_firstname.html
        - CSS files shall go in static/css/about_firstname/, e.g static/css/about_firstname/main.css
        - Javascript files shall go in static/js/about_firstname/, e.g static/css/about_firstname/main.js
        - Image files shall go in static/img/about_firstname/, e.g static/img/about_firstname/me.jpg
    - Shall have a page ready by TUESDAY 2018-09-18 at 4pm.

Frontend team:
    Shall create About page that links to other about pages
    - File shall be static/about.html
    - CSS files shall be in static/css/
    - Javascript files shall be in static/js/
    - Image files shall be in static/img/
    - Shall not hard code Javascript or CSS into <script> or <style> tags
    - Page shall use Bootstrap 4
    - Shall have a page ready by TUESDAY 2018-09-18 at 4pm.

Backend team:
    Shall create an ExpressJS server that serves the About pages.
    - Main application shall be named app.js (root project directory)
    - Shall make node_modules ignored by git
        - Every member shall have to download the packages themselves by navigating to the directory and running "npm install"
        - The only required dependency, ExpressJS, shall be specified in packages.json
    - Shall have a SETTINGS template file named settings_template.js that is synced on git
    - Shall use SETTINGS.js, that is identicle to settings_template.js, but not synced (add to .gitignore)
        - The port number of the server shall use a port number in the SETTINGS.js file
    - Shall serve the entire static directory directly as the root. e.g http://1.2.3.4/about_jack.html -> static/about_jack.html
    - Shall branch off "develop" branch and name each feature properly
    - Shall be done by TUESDAY 2018-09-18 at 4pm.
